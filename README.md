# hello-world
Hi.

I'm Dennis. I have a degree in computer engineering.
Due to lack of experience in the field, I have yet to get a job in said field.
I am creating this account in an attempt to brush up on my programming knowledge
and hopefully connect with people who can help me in my pursuit of a career.
